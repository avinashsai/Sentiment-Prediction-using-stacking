# Sentiment-Prediction-using-stacking

Stacking is an Ensemble technique popularly used in Kaggle competitions. Inspired by this http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/06/15/stacking-made-easy-an-introduction-to-stacknet-by-competitions-grandmaster-marios-michailidis-kazanova/ tutorial on Stacking, I implemented stacking from scratch and used it to predict sentiments of movie reviews.

Dataset is taken from Sentiment Labelled Sentences from UCI Repository.

I am planning to extend to Neural Networks as well.
